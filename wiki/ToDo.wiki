#summary Immediate, near-term and long-term todo items & goals for plop

= Immediate =

  * Add more todo items, explain the existing items in more detail
  * The current routine used for maxima simplification is maxima::simplify. It would be nice at some point to try other routines and their combinations, e.g. maxima::factor and maxima::ratsimp
  * Do large-scale testing of Boolean and mixed simplification against the C++ implementation, complete the Boolean reduction rule implementation
  * Add some routines for randomly sampling trees (based e.g. on an extension of the [http://metacog.org/papers/gecco07b.pdf GECCO diversity paper])
  * Extend the current trivial hillclimber to encompass lists, tuples, and functions
  * Wikify and publicize conceptual docs (including a description of the FullSetOfBenchmarks)

= Short-term =

  * Extend the plop minilanguage to action-perception and enum types. Think more carefully about side-effects.
  * Implement a non-trivial learning algorithm
  * Implement nontrivial representation-building for "flat" knobs
  * Implemented deme management
  * Run some interesting benchmarks on Boolean & real-valued & mixed datasets

= Long-term =

  * Implement procedural abstraction via datamining & via direct transformation
  * Primitive-recursive operations and associated transformations via either fold or explicit recursion
  * Run benchmarks on the FullSetOfBenchmarks
  * Exploiting uncertain background knowledge, learning coupling rules, metalearning
